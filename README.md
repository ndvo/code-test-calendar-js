# JS Calendar

This application was built as a part of a code challenge for Vanhack.

The requirements were:

- You must be able to create, edit, view and erase an event
- It must be built with Javascript
- No library was mentioned, so no one was used
- It must be responsive


## Highlights

The application features the usage of the template tag to build a reactive interface using vanilla javascript.

## Style

The styles are too simple. I am not a designer myself, so I try not to make it too complex, but I did try to use new HTML tags such as template and dialog in order to demonstrate their usage.

## Code

The templates are writen within the HTML as templates tags.

Calendar.js inserts a new date for each day in the calendar and then fill the appropriate values, taking advantage of the \*-unknown id present in the template.
